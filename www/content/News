<h2>CSS updated, searching images and searching a good free 24/7 host</h2>
<p>
The CSS styling has now been updated but still needs some work. Also I am need of some images on this website so if you know a place to put one and/or you can make some for me, please contact me. At the moment I am using the free service koding to host/develop my website on. Unfortunately after 60 minutes of inactivity the server shuts down so if anyone knows a good free hosting service, please contact me.<br><br>
I hope you had fun browsing my website while it is online :D

<h2>Website is now online!</h2>

After some work I finally got the website built. I loved building this website with it's asynchronous page loading and such. I built this website because I needed a place to put the documentation of my CsvDatabaseLibrary. And of course I needed a place to put all my projects. The css needs some more work though and some more images would be nice. If you have any suggestions on how to improve the website don't hesitate to send me an email or a message on social media.
