<h2>New fonts</h2>
<p>
I have changed the font used on the website to a more fitting font by watching the very helpful video by CodeSchool.com. I think it has made the website look much cleaner and more modern. I hope you like it too.

<h2>Moved to 000webhost.com</h2>
<p>
The website has now been moved to a new host(<a href="http://www.000webhost.com/">000webhost</a>). So now the website should be online most of the time. I however dislike the fact that sometimes an add will popup. Unfortunately I don't have enough money to pay for a paid host so for the moment you'll have to deal with the ads. As mentioned in the previous news post I am still looking for images and tips to improve the styling of this website. If you know a better host(without advertising) that is still free. I'd like to ask you to contact me with one of the ways found on the contact page.

<h2>CSS updated, searching images and searching a good free 24/7 host</h2>
<p>
The CSS styling has now been updated but still needs some work. Also I am need of some images on this website so if you know a place to put one and/or you can make some for me, please contact me. At the moment I am using the free service koding to host/develop my website on. Unfortunately after 60 minutes of inactivity the server shuts down so if anyone knows a good free hosting service, please contact me.<br><br>
I hope you had fun browsing my website while it is online :D

<h2>Website is now online!</h2>
<p>
After some work I finally got the website built. I loved building this website with it's asynchronous page loading and such. I built this website because I needed a place to put the documentation of my CsvDatabaseLibrary. And of course I needed a place to put all my projects. The css needs some more work though and some more images would be nice. If you have any suggestions on how to improve the website don't hesitate to send me an email or a message on social media.
